# Inspo
Simple app with inspiration pictures and a widget. 

## What it will look like
It will be an app that is connected to some museum API and showing the random paintings from said museum collections. It will have only two elements to begin with - a picture and refresh button. 

To make it a bit trickier , my mentor and I decided to add some animation to the button, so the refresh will happened when the user pull the button to refresh the image. Plus I want to add the placeholder image in case loading a new one will take some time.

## To do list
- [x] Create a new project on GitHub
- [x] Write a ReadMe
- [x] Create a basic layout
- [ ] Create a beautiful button
- [ ] Add button animation
- [ ] Add API request logic
- [ ] Test the app
- [ ] Add a frame for the picture

## Credits and acknowledgments
First of all I want to say thank you for my mentor who reviews my numerous app ideas and push requests - [@togramago](https://github.com/togramago).

Iâ€™m planning to use [Code with Enid](https://twitter.com/ios_dev_alb) as a reference material for this project and follow some of the steps in [@SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking) guides on Youtube. I will add details as it goes.
