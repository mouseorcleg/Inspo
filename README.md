# Inspo

Inspo is a simple app that provides you with a source of inspiration at your fingertips. With just one pull of a button, you’ll be able to see one randomly selected picture from the Harvard Museum collection. No information, just pure visual inspiration! 


## Credits and acknowledgments
First of all I want to say thank you for my mentor who reviews my numerous app ideas and push requests - [@togramago](https://github.com/togramago).

I’m planning to use [Code with Enid](https://twitter.com/ios_dev_alb) as a reference material for this project and follow some of the steps in [@SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking) guides on Youtube. I will add details as it goes.
