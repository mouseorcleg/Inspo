# Inspo

Inspo is a simple app that provides you with a source of inspiration at your fingertips. With just one pull of a button, you‚Äôll be able to see one randomly selected picture from the Harvard Museum collection. No information, just pure visual inspiration! 

## üõ† Technologies
* **MVVM** architecture and **SwiftUI** were employed to create the user interface and data flow of the Inspo app. 
* A **separate networking level** was developed to decode **JSON** responses from the **Harvard Museum API** and a repository and protocol were implemented to ensure the persistence of the data. 
* **AsyncImage** was used for displaying the main picture and **DragGesture** was utilised to allow the user to trigger updates to the picture. 
* The launch screen (only) was designed using **Storyboard**.

## üó∫ Roadmap
### ‚úàÔ∏è Start of the journey

The Inspo app was created as an exercise set by my mentor to develop skills in working with images and JSON responses. The task was to find a public API, set up a networking layer, and handle the image loading within the app.

As an art historian, I saw the opportunity to provide users with a unique and memorable experience of exploring artwork. By using the [Harvard Art Museum API](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api), Inspo allows users to discover art without any preconceived notions or additional information, giving them the chance to form their own opinions and interpretations. Whether you are an artist seeking inspiration or simply curious about the museum‚Äôs collection, Inspo provides an stress-free way to engage with art and discover something new.

Hope you enjoy using Inspo!


## Credits and acknowledgments
First of all I want to say thank you for my mentor who reviews my numerous app ideas and push requests - [@togramago](https://github.com/togramago).

I‚Äôm planning to use [Code with Enid](https://twitter.com/ios_dev_alb) as a reference material for this project and follow some of the steps in [@SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking) guides on Youtube. I will add details as it goes.
