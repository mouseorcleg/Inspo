# Inspo

Inspo is a simple app that provides you with a source of inspiration at your fingertips. With just one pull of a button, youâ€™ll be able to see one randomly selected picture from the Harvard Museum collection. No information, just pure visual inspiration! 

## ðŸ›  Technologies
* **MVVM** architecture and **SwiftUI** were employed to create the user interface and data flow of the Inspo app. 
* A **separate networking level** was developed to decode **JSON** responses from the **Harvard Museum API** and a repository and protocol were implemented to ensure the persistence of the data. 
* **AsyncImage** was used for displaying the main picture and **DragGesture** was utilised to allow the user to trigger updates to the picture. 
* The launch screen (only) was designed using **Storyboard**.


## Credits and acknowledgments
First of all I want to say thank you for my mentor who reviews my numerous app ideas and push requests - [@togramago](https://github.com/togramago).

Iâ€™m planning to use [Code with Enid](https://twitter.com/ios_dev_alb) as a reference material for this project and follow some of the steps in [@SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking) guides on Youtube. I will add details as it goes.
